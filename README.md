# odin-landing-page

This webpage is made using HTML, CSS, and flexbox.  
The design is modeled after these two images from The Odin Project: [Full Design](/design/odin-project.png), [Color and Fonts](/design/colors_and_stuff.png)  
Some features:  
  * Made with desktop in mind; not very resposive (mobile).
  * Uses containers (divs) in conjunction with flexbox to place elements in desired locations.
  * Content and elements rearrange according to window size.
  * Has padding and margin to create spacing between elements.
  * Uses the flex-wrap property so that the infographics can shift above or below when needed.
  * Makes use of properties such as border-radius for styling.
